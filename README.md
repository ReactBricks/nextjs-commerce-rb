# Next.js Commerce

A high-perfomance, server-rendered Next.js App Router ecommerce application.

This template uses React Server Components, Server Actions, `Suspense`, `useOptimistic`, and more.

## React Bricks integration

With [React Bricks](https://www.reactbricks.com), you can edit the store pages and product details pages in a visual way.  
React Bricks will keep this integration repository up-to-date with the Next.js Commerce repository.

### React Bricks Setup

In order to use this project with React Bricks visual headless CMS, you'll need to [create a free React Bricks account](https://www.reactbricks.com/sign-up), create a React Bricks App from the [Dashboard](https://dashboard.reactbricks.com/) and set the React Bricks App credentials in the `.env` file:

- `API_KEY="xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_ID="xxxxxxxx-xxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENVIRONMENT="main"`
- `REACT_BRICKS_REVALIDATE="1"` (in production rise this value to 600 to leverage caching)

### Shopify Setup

To set up the Shopify Store, you may follow the [Vercel and Shopify Integration guide](https://vercel.com/docs/integrations/ecommerce/shopify), with the following exceptions:

- **You don't need to create pages like "About us"**, "Privacy" etc. in Shopify, because you can create them in React Bricks
- **You don't need to create the footer menu** in Shopify, as it is managed in React Bricks
- **You need to create a page in React Bricks for each product**, ensuring the "slug" matches the product slug on Shopify (this step won't be required any more in the future, as we'll automate it).

## Providers

Vercel will only be actively maintaining a Shopify version [as outlined in our vision and strategy for Next.js Commerce](https://github.com/vercel/commerce/pull/966).

Vercel is happy to partner and work with any commerce provider to help them get a similar template up and running and listed below. Alternative providers should be able to fork this repository and swap out the `lib/shopify` file with their own implementation while leaving the rest of the template mostly unchanged.

## Integrations

Integrations enable upgraded or additional functionality for Next.js Commerce

- [Orama](https://github.com/oramasearch/nextjs-commerce) ([Demo](https://vercel-commerce.oramasearch.com/))

  - Upgrades search to include typeahead with dynamic re-rendering, vector-based similarity search, and JS-based configuration.
  - Search runs entirely in the browser for smaller catalogs or on a CDN for larger.

- [React Bricks](https://github.com/ReactBricks/nextjs-commerce-rb) ([Demo](https://nextjs-commerce.reactbricks.com/))
  - Edit pages, product details, and footer content visually using [React Bricks](https://www.reactbricks.com) visual headless CMS.

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run Next.js Commerce. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control your Shopify store.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Your app should now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).
